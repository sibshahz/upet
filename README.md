# :wave: Say hi to uPet theme:
# Link to live theme is given below:
www.upet-dev.myshopify.com
...
# What I did in this:
I created a one page template with customize able sections and one section with blocks name as  "features"
I have made some options to change different settings from within sections and also from theme settings such as Font Family, Size, Color etc, ofcourse I can do more but for that I need more time. Goal was to give a test and I hope I did good. 	:crossed_fingers:
 

## How to use

To use this repository for making Shopify themes, use the following command of Shopify CLI.
```sh
shopify theme init [ NAME OF YOUR THEME ] --clone-url https://github.com/sibshahz/upet
```

```sh
shopify login --store [ link to your store ] 
```

```sh
shopify theme serve
```

If you don't have Shopify CLI installed to your computer, navigate to the [installation page of Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/installation).

# How to setup
After 'shopify theme serve' open customizer link provided by shopify CLI also the preview link for preview

OR

After installing theme and publishing it to the store , Goto -> Online Store -> Themes and select Customize.
There you would have sections:

1. Announcement Section (for top bar contact number etc)
2. Head Section (for adding logo)
3. Main Hero Section (Customizing images and text for main hero section)
4. Feature Section (Customize, add or remove blocks limited to 6)
5. Hero shot section (Customizing images and text for hero shot section)
6. Footer section (customize footer text and add/remove/edit links to social media)
7. At bottom you would have theme settings where you can further customize some options for the theme.
