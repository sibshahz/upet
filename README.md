# :wave: Say hi to uPet theme:
# Link to live theme is given below:

# What I did in this:
I created a one page template with customize able sections and blocks for one section "features"
I have made some options to change background and font color, ofcourse I can do more but for that I need more time. Goal was to give a test and I hope I did good.
 

## How to use
